  description: |
    Researchers often have a hard time quickly figuring out how their
    computational workloads are doing. The way cluster data is currently
    shown through the system can be overwhelming and hard to
    interpret, especially for someone who isn't deeply familiar with
    how everything works. It's not always obvious whether their jobs
    are running smoothly, stuck, or underperforming.

    That's what this project set out to fix. We wanted to build tools
    that make it easier for researchers to understand what's going on
    with their jobs, without having to dig through complicated logs
    or system outputs. A big part of the process was also figuring
    out what information researchers actually care about most, and
    how we could present that in a way that's simple, useful, and
    clear.
