fellowship:
  name: Tracking server inventory and elevation
  description: |
    The CHTC maintains over 1,000 servers on the UWâ€“Madison campus and 
    across the country. Keeping track of server elevation (datacenter 
    and rack location), serial numbers, asset tags is a challenge that 
    is always in need of improvement. This project will focus on taking 
    existing data from the CHTC hardware monitoring system and automatically 
    exporting it to other systems such as Google spreadsheets or ITAdvisor.
    After a successful summer, the student fellow will gain skills in 
    Python and monitoring and Google Docs APIs.
  mentor: Joe Bartowiak
