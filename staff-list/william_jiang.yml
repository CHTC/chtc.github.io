fellowship:
  name: Integrating Pelican and Globus
  description: |
    The Pelican Platform is an open-source software platform designed to create
    data federations by unifying diverse data repositories (e.g. POSIX
    filesystems, S3) under a single architecture. It differs from the Globus
    project, whose main goal is to facilitate peer-to-peer data transfer, and it
    thus lacks the means to plug into cluster scheduling frameworks like HTCondor.

    This project focused on bridging the gap between Pelican and Globus by
    integrating Globus transfer capabilities into Pelican. This will allow users
    to leverage Globus's robust data transfer features while benefiting from
    Pelican's unified data access model. The integration involved developing a
    Globus backend for Pelican and enabling seamless data transfers between
    Pelican-managed repositories and external systems via Globus.
