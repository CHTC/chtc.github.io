  name: Schedd performance analysis for human
  description: |
    The condor_schedd is a single threaded program, and when it is overloaded, 
    it is difficult for administrators to understand why.  There are some
    statistics about what it is doing, but there is no clear way to present
    this information in a useful way to an administrator. Students working 
    on this project would build visualizations of complex data, and work
    with end users and facilitators to tune output for real world human 
    consumption.
