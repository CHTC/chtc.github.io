fellowship:
  name: Enhancing container image build system
  description: |
    Container images are a widely used technology to package and distribute 
    software and services for use in systems such as Docker or Kubernetes.
    The PATh project builds hundreds of these images on a weekly basis but 
    the build system needs improvement to support more images and additional
    use cases. This project will focus on taking the existing system and 
    adding configurable, per-image build options. After a successful summer,
    the student fellow will gain skills in Docker containers, GitHub actions, and Bash.
  mentor: Brian Lin
