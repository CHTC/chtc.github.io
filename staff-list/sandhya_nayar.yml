  name: Smart Aggregation and Indexing with the Archive Librarian
  description: |
    HTCondor saves large amounts of useful data about finished jobs
    that can help administrators, facilitators, and researchers
    who are trying to utilize historical job data. Currently,
    condor_history manually parses through flat files to get users
    their data; this makes it significantly harder to use, especially
    for older jobs, with no easy way to create useful aggregates.
    
    This project focused on the creation of the “Archive Librarian” service,
    to index job records from the HTCondor history archive and
    improve the usability of historical job data. Each job's “address”,
    which is the combination of an offset and file metadata of a
    historical archive file, is stored in a database. This allows
    the librarian to directly locate job records and avoid using a
    sequential scan. The database also stores relevant job attributes
    that researchers commonly rely on, enabling future support for
    complicated queries and aggregate statistics.
