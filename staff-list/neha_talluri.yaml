  description: |
    In PATh, an important part of the infrastructure is the “glidein”, a client that
    starts at a remote location and provides computational cycles for research.
    In the past, glideins have relied on configuration at remote locations to
    determine their location but this often results in missing or incorrect 
    information. This project will focus on enhancing glideins so that they
    can detect and report where they are running in the world, possibly including
    data like geolocation and institutional owner. After a successful summer,
    the student fellow will gain skills in Python, bash, and layer 3 networking.
  mentor: Jason Patton
