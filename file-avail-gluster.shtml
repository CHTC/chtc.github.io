<h2>Best Practices for File Delivery</h2>

<p>Remember to review best practices in our File Handling guide, 
including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-split large input files when each of many jobs will only need a portion of the 
large input data.</li>
<li>Remove ALL unwanted/temporary files in the working director of the job that have 
appeared since the job started.</li>
<li>Use tar with compression (*.tar.gz) for any relevant input/output files and ALL 
desired output directories prior to their transfer/delivery.</li>
</ul>
-->


<p>CHTC maintains a Gluster file share, which should only be used for
files or software that are too large for HTCondor file transfer or SQUID. 
The below guide discusses how to use CHTC's Gluster option for jobs that
use or produce very large files.</p>

<a name="policy"></a>
<h2>1. Policies and Intended Use:</h2>

<dl>
        <dt>Intended Use:</dt> <dd>Gluster is a staging area for input files,
        output files, and software that are individually too large for file transfer or SQUID. 
	Files and software within Gluster will be available only to jobs running in the CHTC Pool, 
	and only a portion of the pool.</dd>
        <dt>Access to Gluster:</dt> <dd>is granted upon request to chtc@cs.wisc.edu and consultation with a Research Computing Facilitator. 
	</dd>
        <dt>Limitations: </dt> <dd><ul>
                <li><b>Access outside of CHTC?</b> Jobs relying on Gluster will only run in CHTC's HTCondor Pool,
		and data in Gluster is not accessible to HTCondor jobs running outside
		of this pool.</li>
		<li><b>Not all files ...</b> Gluster should ONLY be used for individual data and software files
		that are larger than the values in the table, above. Files placed in /mnt/gluster 
		should NEVER be listed in the submit file (for example, as the "executable", 
		"output", "error", or "log" 
		files, or for files listed in "transfer_input_files"). Only files in the user's home 
		directory should ever be listed in these lines of the submit file.</li>
                <li><b>Capacity</b> Each user is allowed a certain amount of space in Gluster,
                though we can increase this space for special requests to chtc@cs.wisc.edu</li>
        </ul></dd>
        <dt>Data Security:</dt> <dd>Files placed in Gluster are owned by the
        user, and only the user's own jobs can access these files (unless the
        user specifically modifies unix file permissions to make certain files
        available for other users).</dd>
	<dt>Data Cleanup:</dt> <dd>As for all CHTC file space, data should be removed from
        /mnt/gluster AS SOON AS IT IS NO LONGER NEEDED FOR ACTIVELY-RUNNING JOBS. Even if 
	it will be used it the future, it should be deleted from Gluster and copied back at a later date.</dd>
	<dt>Allowed Data Amounts:</dt> <dd>As of July 25, 2017, initial quotas of 10GB of 100 files have been 
	implemented for every folder within Gluster. Request to chtc@cs.wisc.edu and consultation with an RCF 
	will be necessary for increasing this quota.</dd>
	<dt>KEEP COPIES:</dt> <dd>of ANY and ALL data or software in Gluster in another, non-CHTC location. 
	The HTC Gluster is not backed up and is prone to data loss over time. CHTC staff reserve the 
	right to remove any data from the HTC Gluser (or any CHTC file system) at any time.
	&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	<dt><b>USERS VIOLATING ANY OF THE POLICIES (also below) IN THIS GUIDE WILL HAVE THEIR GLUSTER ACCESS
	AND/OR CHTC ACCOUNT REVOKED UNTIL CORRECTIVE MEASURES ARE TAKEN. CHTC STAFF RESERVE THE
	RIGHT TO REMOVE ANY PROBLEMATIC USER DATA AT ANY TIME IN ORDER TO PRESERVE PERFORMANCE.</b>&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

<b>The examples and information in the below guide are useful ONLY if:</b><br />
<ul>
	<li>you already have an account on a CHTC-administered submit server</li>
	<li>you already have a user directory in the HTC Gluster system, after 
	requesting it via email discussion to chtc@cs.wisc.edu</li>
</ul>

<b>To best understand the below information, users 
should already be familiar with:</b><br />

	<li>Using the command-line to: navigate directories, 
	create/edit/copy/move/delete files and directories,

<h1>2. Practices for Files within Gluster:</h1>
Data in Gluster should be stored in as few files as possible (ideally, one file per job), and will be used by a job 
only after being copied from /mnt/gluster into the job working directory (see #3, below). 
Similarly, large output requiring Gluster should first be written to the job working directory 
then compressed in to a single file before being copied to /mnt/gluster at the end of the job (see #4, below).
&lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
To prepare job-specific data that is large enough to require Gluster and exists as multiple 
files or directories (or a directory of multiple files), first create a compressed tar package before
placing the file in /mnt/gluster (either before submitting jobs, or within jobs before moving output to /mnt/gluster). 
For example:
<pre class="term">$ tar -czvf job_package.tar.gz file_or_dir <file2> <directory> <etc.>&lt;/pre&gt;

<p> Movement of data into/out of /mnt/gluster before and after jobs should 
only be performed via CHTC's transfer server, as below, and <b>not via a CHTC submit server.</b>
After obtaining a user directory within <code>/mnt/gluster</code> and an account on 
the transfer server, copy relevant files directly 
into this user directory from your own computer:</p>

<p>Example <code>scp</code> command on your own Linux or Mac computer:</p>
<pre class="term">$ scp large.file username@transfer.chtc.wisc.edu:/mnt/gluster/username/</pre>

<p>If using a Windows computer:</p>
<p>Using a file transfer application, like WinSCP, directly drag the large 
file from its location on your computer to a location within 
<code>/mnt/gluster/username/</code> on transfer.chtc.wisc.edu.</p>

<a name="submit"></a>
<h1>3. Submit File Implications</h1>

<p>In order to properly submit jobs using Gluster, always do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ONLY submit Gluster-dependent jobs from within your home 
	directory (<code>/home/username</code>), and NEVER from within 
	<code>/mnt/gluster</code>. </li>

	<li>Do NOT list any <code>/mnt/gluster</code> files in any 
	of the submit file lines, 
	including: <code>executable, log, output, error, transfer_input_files</code>. 
	Rather, your job's ENTIRE interaction with files in <code>/mnt/gluster</code> 
	needs to occur WITHIN each job's executable, when it runs within the job. </li>

	<li>Request an adequate amount of disk space with "<code>request_disk</code>", 
	to include the total amount of input data that each job will copy into the job working 
	directory from /mnt/gluster, and any output that will be created in the job working
	directory.</li>

	<li>Make sure to use a submit file "Requirements" line so that	
	your jobs only run on execute servers that have access to Gluster.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the below submit file, as an example, which would be submitted 
from within the user's home directory:</p>

<pre class="sub">### Example submit file for a single Gluster-dependent job
# Files for the below lines MUST all be somewhere within /home/username,
# and not within /mnt/gluster/username

log = myprogram.log
executable = run_myprogram.sh
output = $(Cluster).out
error = $(Cluster).err
transfer_input_files = myprogram

# IMPORTANT! Require execute servers that have Gluster:
Requirements = (Target.HasGluster == true)

# Make sure to still include lines like "request_memory", "request_disk", "request_cpus", etc. 

queue
</pre>

<a name="input"></a>
<h1>4. Using Gluster-staged Files and Software for Jobs</h1>

<p>As stated in <a href="#submit">#2</a>, all interaction with 
files and software in <code>/mnt/gluster</code> 
should occur within your job's main executable, when it runs. 
Therefore, there are two options for jobs depending on on Gluster-staged software (larger than 
a few GB) and input (larger than 100 MB per file).</p>

<a name="copy"></a>
<h2>A. Copy files from Gluster into the working directory, from within the job</h2>

<p>The recommended method is to have your job executable copy input or software from /mnt/gluster into the working directory of the job, and use it from there, being careful to remove such files from the working directory before the completion of the job (so that they're not copied back to the submit server as perceived output).

An example is below:

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash
#
# First, copy the compressed tar file from /mnt/gluster into the working directory,
#  and un-tar it to reveal your large input file(s) or directories:
cp /mnt/gluster/username/large_input.tar.gz ./
tar -xzvf large_input.tar.gz
#
# Command for myprogram, which will use files from the working directory
./myprogram large_input.txt myoutput.txt
#
# Before the script exits, make sure to remove the file(s) from the working directory
rm large_input.tar.gz large_input.txt
#
# END</pre>


<a name="large"></a>
<h2>B. Software that is too large for or doesn't work with file transfer</h2>

<p>
If your software will ONLY work if it remains in the same location where it was 
first installedi, and there are barriers to installing it within the working directory 
of every job (install-on-the-fly), please contact us for assistance. DO NOT PLACE SOFTWARE
IN GLUSTER WITHOUT PERMISSION AND INPUT FROM CHTC STAFF: chtc@cs.wisc.edu

<a name="within"></a>
<h1>5. Copying large output files to Gluster from within a job</h1>

<p>As stated in <a href="#submit">#2</a>, all 
interaction with files in <code>/mnt/gluster</code> 
should occur within your designated "executable", when it runs. 
Therefore, there are two options for having steps within your 
executable write files to Gluster, as well as a consideration 
for large standard output.</p>
<a name="working"></a>
<h2>A. Write output files to the working directory, 
then move these to Gluster</h2>

<p>If your jobs write any data directly to Gluster from 
within a job, your jobs will run slower AND will cause Gluster to be slower for other users.  
Instead, have your executable write the file 
to a location within the working directory, and then make sure to move 
this large file to Gluster (or copy to Gluster, and then remove from 
the working directory), so that it's not transferred back to the home 
directory, as all other "new" files in the working directory will be. </p>

<p>Example, if executable is a shell script:</p>
<pre class="file">#!/bin/bash
# 
# Command to save output to the working directory:
./myprogram myinput.txt large_output.txt
#
# Tar and copy output to Gluster, then delete from the job working directory:
tar -czvf large_output.tar.gz large_output.txt <other_large_files_or_dirs>
mv large_output.tar.gz /mnt/gluster/username/<subdirectory>
rm large_output.txt
#
# END&lt;/pre&gt;
<a name="also"></a>
<h2>B. ALSO consider: Large standard output ("screen output") produced 
by your jobs</h2>

<p>In some instances, your software may produce very large standard 
output (what would typically be output to the command screen, if you 
ran the command for yourself, instead of having HTCondor do it). Because 
such standard output from your software will usually be captured by 
HTCondor in the submit file "output" file, this "output" file WILL 
still be transferred by HTCondor back to your home directory on the 
submit server, which may be very bad for you and others, if that captured 
standard output is very large.</p>

<p>In these cases, it is useful to redirect the standard output 
of commands in your executable to a file in the working directory, and then 
move it into Gluster at the end of the job.</p>

<p>Example, if "<code>myprogram</code>" produces very large standard output, and 
is run from a script (bash) executable:</p>

<pre class="file">#!/bin/bash
#
# script to run myprogram,
# 
# redirecting large standard output to a file in the working directory:
./myprogram myinput.txt myoutput.txt &gt; large_std.out
# 
# tar and move large files to Gluster so they're not copied to the submit server:
tar -czvf large_stdout.tar.gz larg_stdout
cp large_stdout.tar.gz /mnt/gluster/username/<subdirectory>
rm large_std.out large_stdout.tar.gz
# END&lt;/pre&gt;

<a name="after"></a>
<h1>6. Removing files from Gluster after jobs complete</h1>

<p>Similar to the procedures from transferring files into Gluster,
you can directly copy files out of Gluster using command-line <code>scp</code>
or file-transfer applications like WinSCP.</p>
<a name="check"></a>
<h1>7. Checking your Quota, Data Use, and File Counts in Gluster</h1>

<p>To check your total data usage and quota, run <code>df -h</code> for your Gluster directory. Example:
<pre>
$ df -h /mnt/gluster/alice
</pre>

<p>To check data usage and file counts, run <code>ncdu</code> from within 
the directory you'd like to query. Example:
<pre>
$ cd /mnt/gluster/alice
$ ncdu
</pre>
When <code>ncdu</code> has finished running, 
the output will give you a total file count and allow you to navigate between 
subdirectories for even more details. Type <code>q</code> when you're ready to 
exit the output viewer. More info here:
