<h1>Available Positions</h1>


<p>
If advancing the state of the art of distributed computing in an academic environment interests you, 
the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) offers a 
unique working environment. Our project&rsquo;s home is in the UW Department of Computer Sciences, an 
internationally recognized department consistently ranked in the top ten across the USA. A position with 
CHTC will provide you the opportunity to interact with both department faculty and students to translate 
novel ideas into real-world solutions. The software and infrastructure you will be working on is used by
scientists and engineers at hundreds of institutions, from universities to national laboratories and from
large high tech corporations to small animation teams.
<p>
The CHTC is home to a large distributed campus infrastructure that helps scientists on and off campus advance
their research. We also develop the <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/">HTCondor Software</a> for

HTCondor powers the CHTC and is used by scientists and businesses around the world. We are involved
in many collaborations, including (but not limited to) <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/">The Open Science Grid</a>.
