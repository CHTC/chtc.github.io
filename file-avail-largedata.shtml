<h2>Best Practices for File Delivery</h2>

<p>Remember to review best practices in our File Handling guide, 
including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-split large input files when each of many jobs will only need a portion of the 
large input data.</li>
<li>Remove ALL unwanted/temporary files in the working director of the job that have 
appeared since the job started.</li>
<li>Use tar with compression (*.tar.gz) for any relevant input/output files and ALL 
desired output directories prior to their transfer/delivery.</li>
</ul>
-->


<p>When submitting jobs to CHTC’s High Throughput Computing (HTC) system, 
there is a distinct location for staging data that is too large to be 
handled at scale via the default HTCondor file transfer mechanism. This 
location should be used for jobs that require input files larger than 100MB
and/or that generate output files larger than 3-4GB.</p>

<p><strong>To best understand the below information, users should already be
familiar with:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Using the command-line to: navigate directories,
create/edit/copy/move/delete files and directories, and run intended
programs (aka “executables”).</li>

<h1 id="1-policies-and-intended-use">1. Policies and Intended Use</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>USERS VIOLATING ANY OF THE POLICIES IN THIS GUIDE WILL
HAVE THEIR DATA STAGING ACCESS AND/OR CHTC ACCOUNT REVOKED UNTIL CORRECTIVE
MEASURES ARE TAKEN. CHTC STAFF RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REMOVE ANY
PROBLEMATIC USER DATA AT ANY TIME IN ORDER TO PRESERVE PERFORMANCE.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-intended-use">A. Intended Use</h2>

<p>Our large data staging location is only for input and output files that 
are individually too large to be managed by our other data movement 
methods, HTCondor file transfer or SQUID. This includes individual input files 
greater than 100MB and individual output files greater than 3-4GB.</p>

<p>Users are expected to abide by this intended use expectation and follow the 
instructions for using <code>/staging</code> written in this guide (e.g. files placed 
in <code>/staging </code>should NEVER be listed in the submit file, but rather accessed 
via the job’s executable (aka .sh) script).</p>

<h2 id="b-access-to-large-data-staging">B. Access to Large Data Staging</h2>

<p>Any one with a CHTC account whose data meets the intended use above can request 
space in our large data staging area. A Research Computing Facilitator will 
review the request and follow up. If appropriate, access will be granted via 
a directory in the system and a quota. Quotas are based on individual user needs; 
if a larger quota is needed, email chtc@cs.wisc.edu with your request.</p>

<p>We can also create group or shared spaces by request.</p>

<h2 id="c-user-data-management-responsibilities">C. User Data Management Responsibilities</h2>

<p>As with all CHTC file spaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Keep copies</strong>: Our large data staging area is not backed up and has the 
possibility of data loss; keep copies of ANY and ALL data in <code>/staging</code> in another, non-CHTC
location.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove data</strong>: We expect that users remove data from <code>/staging</code> AS
SOON AS IT IS NO LONGER NEEDED FOR ACTIVELY-RUNNING JOBS.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitor usage and quota</strong>: Each <code>/staging</code> folder has both a size and “items” quota. Quota changes 
can be requested by emailing chtc@cs.wisc.edu.</li>
</ul>

<p>CHTC staff reserve the right to remove data from our large data staging 
location (or any CHTC file system) at any time.</p>

<h2 id="d-data-access-within-jobs">D. Data Access Within Jobs</h2>

<p>Staged large data will 
be available only within the the CHTC pool, on a subset of our total 
capacity.</p>

<p>Staged data are owned by the user, and only the user’s own
jobs can access these files (unless the user specifically modifies unix
file permissions to make certain files available for other users).</p>

<h1 id="2-staging-large-data">2. Staging Large Data</h1>

<p>In order to stage large data for use on CHTC’s HTC system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Get a directory</strong>: Large data staging is available by request.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce file counts</strong>: Combine and compress files that are used together.</li>
  <li><strong>Use the transfer server</strong>: Upload your data via our dedicated file transfer server.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove files after jobs complete</strong>: our data staging space is quota controlled and not backed up.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-get-a-directory">A. Get a Directory</h2>

<p>Space in our large data staging area is granted by request. If you think you need 
a directory, email CHTC’s Research Computing Facilitators (chtc@cs.wisc.edu).</p>

<p>The created directory will exist at this path: <code>/staging/username</code></p>

<h2 id="b-reduce-file-counts">B. Reduce File Counts</h2>

<p>Data placed in our large data <code>/staging</code> location 
should be stored in as few files as possible (ideally,
one file per job), and will be used by a job only after being copied
from <code>/staging</code> into the job working directory (see <a href="#3-using-staged-files-in-a-job">below</a>).
Similarly, large output should first be written to the
job working directory then compressed in to a single file before being
copied to <code>/staging</code> at the end of the job.</p>

<p>To prepare job-specific data that is large enough to pre-staging
and exists as multiple files or directories (or a directory of multiple
files), first create a compressed tar package before placing the file in
<code>/staging</code> (either before submitting jobs, or within jobs before
moving output to /staging). For example:</p>

<pre class="term"><code>$ tar -czvf job_package.tar.gz file_or_dir 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="c-use-the-transfer-server">C. Use the Transfer Server</h2>

<p>Movement of data into/out of <code>/staging</code> before and after jobs should
only be performed via CHTC’s transfer server, as below, and <strong>not via a
CHTC submit server.</strong> After obtaining a user directory within
<code>/staging</code> and an account on the transfer server, copy relevant
files directly into this user directory from your own computer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example <code>scp</code> command on your own Linux or Mac computer:
    <pre><code class="language-{.term}">$ scp large.file username@transfer.chtc.wisc.edu:/staging/username/ 
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>If using a Windows computer:
    <ul>
      <li>Using a file transfer application, like WinSCP, directly drag the large
file from its location on your computer to a location within
<code>/staging/username/</code> on transfer.chtc.wisc.edu.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="d-remove-files-after-jobs-complete">D. Remove Files After Jobs Complete</h2>

<p>As with all CHTC file spaces, data should be removed from <code>/staging</code> AS
SOON AS IT IS NO LONGER NEEDED FOR ACTIVELY-RUNNING JOBS. Even if it
will be used it the future, it should be deleted from and copied
back at a later date. Files can be taken off of <code>/staging</code> using similar 
mechanisms as uploaded files (as above).</p>

<h1 id="3-using-staged-files-in-a-job">3. Using Staged Files in a Job</h1>

<p>As shown above, the staging directory for large data is <code>/staging/username</code>. 
All interaction with files in this location should occur within your job’s 
main executable.</p>

<h2 id="a-accessing-large-input-files">A. Accessing Large Input Files</h2>

<p>To use large data placed in the <code>/staging</code> location, add commands to your 
job executable that copy input 
from <code>/staging</code> into the working directory of the job. Program should then use 
files from the working directory, being careful to remove the coiped 
files from the working
directory before the completion of the job (so that they’re not copied
back to the submit server as perceived output).</p>

<p>Example, if executable is a shell script:</p>

<pre class="file"><code>#!/bin/bash
#
# First, copy the compressed tar file from /staging into the working directory,
#  and un-tar it to reveal your large input file(s) or directories:
cp /staging/username/large_input.tar.gz ./
tar -xzvf large_input.tar.gz
#
# Command for myprogram, which will use files from the working directory
./myprogram large_input.txt myoutput.txt
#
# Before the script exits, make sure to remove the file(s) from the working directory
rm large_input.tar.gz large_input.txt
#
# END
</code></pre>

<h2 id="b-moving-large-output-files">B. Moving Large Output Files</h2>

<p>If jobs produce large (more than 3-4GB) output files, have 
your executable write the output file(s) to a location within
the working directory, and then make sure to move this large file to
the <code>/staging</code> folder, so that it’s not transferred back to the home directory, as
all other “new” files in the working directory will be.</p>

<p>Example, if executable is a shell script:</p>

<pre class="file"><code>#!/bin/bash
# 
# Command to save output to the working directory:
./myprogram myinput.txt output_dir/
#
# Tar and mv output to staging, then delete from the job working directory:
tar -czvf large_output.tar.gz output_dir/ other_large_files.txt
mv large_output.tar.gz /staging/username/
rm other_large_files.txt
#
# END
</code></pre>

<h2 id="c-handling-standard-output-if-needed">C. Handling Standard Output (if needed)</h2>

<p>In some instances, your software may produce very large standard output
(what would typically be output to the command screen, if you ran the
command for yourself, instead of having HTCondor do it). Because such
standard output from your software will usually be captured by HTCondor
in the submit file “output” file, this “output” file WILL still be
transferred by HTCondor back to your home directory on the submit
server, which may be very bad for you and others, if that captured
standard output is very large.</p>

<p>In these cases, it is useful to redirect the standard output of commands
in your executable to a file in the working directory, and then move it
into <code>/staging</code> at the end of the job.</p>

<p>Example, if “<code>myprogram</code>” produces very large standard output, and is
run from a script (bash) executable:</p>

<pre class="file"><code>#!/bin/bash
#
# script to run myprogram,
# 
# redirecting large standard output to a file in the working directory:
./myprogram myinput.txt myoutput.txt &gt; large_std.out
# 
# tar and move large files to staging so they're not copied to the submit server:
tar -czvf large_stdout.tar.gz large_std.out
cp large_stdout.tar.gz /staging/username/subdirectory
rm large_std.out large_stdout.tar.gz
# END
</code></pre>

<h1 id="4-submit-jobs-using-staged-data">4. Submit Jobs Using Staged Data</h1>

<p>In order to properly submit jobs using staged large data, always do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Submit from <code>/home</code></strong>: ONLY submit jobs from within your home directory
  (<code>/home/username</code>), and NEVER from within <code>/staging</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In your submit file:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No large data in the submit file</strong>:  Do NOT list any <code>/staging</code> files in any of the submit file
  lines, including: <code>executable, log, output, error, transfer_input_files</code>. Rather, your
  job’s ENTIRE interaction with files in <code>/staging</code> needs to occur
  WITHIN each job’s executable, when it runs within the job (as shown <a href="#3-using-staged-files-in-a-job">above</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Request sufficient disk space</strong>: Using <code>request_disk</code>, request an amount of disk 
space that reflects the total of a) input data that each job will copy into
  the job working directory from <code>/staging,</code> and b) any output that
  will be created in the job working directory.</li>
  <li><strong>Require access to <code>/staging</code></strong>: Include the CHTC specific attribute that requires 
servers with access to <code>/staging</code></li>
</ul>

<p>See the below submit file, as an example, which would be submitted from
within the user’s <code>/home</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.sub}">### Example submit file for a single job that stages large data
# Files for the below lines MUST all be somewhere within /home/username,
# and not within /staging/username

executable = run_myprogram.sh
log = myprogram.log
output = $(Cluster).out
error = $(Cluster).err

## Do NOT list the large data files here
transfer_input_files = myprogram

# IMPORTANT! Require execute servers that can access /staging
Requirements = (Target.HasCHTCStaging == true)

# Make sure to still include lines like "request_memory", "request_disk", "request_cpus", etc. 

queue
</code></pre>

<h1 id="5-checking-your-quota-data-use-and-file-counts">5. Checking your Quota, Data Use, and File Counts</h1>

<p>To check your total data usage and quota, run <code>df -h</code> for your <code>/staging</code>
directory. Example:</p>

<pre><code>$ df -h /staging/alice
</code></pre>

<p>To check data usage and file counts, run <code>ncdu</code> from within the
directory you’d like to query. Example:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /staging/alice
$ ncdu
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>ncdu</code> has finished running, the output will give you a total file
count and allow you to navigate between subdirectories for even more
details. Type <code>q</code> when you’re ready to exit the output viewer. More info
